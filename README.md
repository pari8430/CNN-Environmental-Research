## Abstract
This research introduces a CNN-based methodology to automate the classification of historical and environmental components from natural history collections. These collections are crucial in documenting biodiversity, climate change, and ecological patterns, but their manual processing poses scalability challenges. 

We employed **transfer learning** using the **VGG16 architecture**, training the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset as a proof of concept. The model achieved a classification accuracy of **61% after 10 epochs**, and confusion matrix analysis provided insights into performance trends. The work demonstrates how deep learning can efficiently assist in organizing large-scale environmental data for research and conservation purposes.
